# Restaurant Waiter App

## Application Overview

This robust application is built on a dedicated server powered by Node.js and leverages Microsoft SQL Server for efficient database management. Designed with both performance and scalability in mind, the application seamlessly integrates backend and frontend functionalities to deliver a superior user experience.

## Key Features

### Secure Waiter Login:
The app features a secure passcode login system for waiters, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access the functionalities.
Authentication is handled server-side, providing an additional layer of security and data integrity.

### Comprehensive Data Management:
The application supports full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing for efficient data handling and management directly from the server.
This ensures that all updates and changes are reflected in real-time across the system.

### Advanced Frontend Development with Flutter:
The user interface is crafted using Flutter, enabling a beautiful, smooth, and responsive experience across various devices and platforms.
Flutter's rich set of pre-designed widgets and capabilities ensures a consistent and modern look and feel.

### State Management with BloC:
The app employs the BloC (Business Logic Component) pattern for state management, ensuring that the app's state is predictable, manageable, and testable.
This results in a more maintainable codebase and a better user experience.

## Technical Highlights

### Node.js: 
Utilized for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it ideal for handling multiple client requests efficiently.

### Microsoft SQL Server:
Chosen for its reliability, scalability, and powerful querying capabilities, ensuring robust data management and storage.
### Flutter:
Selected for its ability to create natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
### BloC Pattern:
Ensures a clear separation of business logic from the UI, making the app easier to understand, test, and maintain.

This comprehensive setup not only boosts performance but also ensures that the application remains scalable and maintainable as it grows. With a secure backend, dynamic frontend, and strong state management, this application stands out as a reliable and efficient solution for modern restaurant management.
